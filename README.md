# git-archive-daemon

git-archive-daemon is an HTTP API for serving archives of git repositories.

It utilizes `git archive` tool for actual archive generation.

## Features

* *Laziness* - Archives are generated on demand, when they're requested.
* *Caching* - Requests for the same combination of tree, prefix and format are
  served from a disk cache.
* *Work pooling* - Archiving is done by workers from a configurable, fixed size
  pool. This allows for putting predictable, limited load on the machine.
* *Request grouping* - When the archive is not cached then all requests for it
  are grouped together and they wait for the single archiving job to complete.
  This avoids duplicate work and allows git-archive-daemon to handle high
  volume of requests.

## Installation

Currently you need Go development environment to build git-archive-daemon.

### API

    GET /<repo-path>[?params]

Params:

* `ref` - branch/tag name or commit sha
* `format` - tar.gz or zip
* `prefix` - (optional) prepended to each filename in the archive (passed to `git
  archive` via `--prefix` option)
* `filename` - (optional) filename for the response, returned in
  `Content-Disposition: attachment` HTTP header.
